# Incident reporting blockchain demo

## Scenario

MedCo is using large data sets that live in AWS s3 for a research application.  The results of the application should be kept encrypted and moved into the corporate private cloud for storage and later use.  This data will be sold to a large pharmaceutical company.

Loss of integrity for this data is critical to the businessâ€™s IP and should be reported and tracked.  In addition to MedCo needing to verify integrity, the purchasing Pharma company will need to verify their purchase has not been compromised.

It could be possible for an employee or a bad actor to thwart the privacy of this data and wipe record of that event taking place.  In order to ensure compliance, we need some method of tracking and preventing alteration of reported incidents.

Blockchain allows for all parties to verify no incidents were reported, or that the incidents reported were handled correctly, and that no tampering of they system has occurred.

Possible con: latency.  Will incidents need to be known in real time, or is some delay reasonable?

On detection of a security incident, a log entry should be made.

### Example incidents

* VMs detected to be running vulnerable software
* Ssh access to VM running the app
* Breach of encryption key security
* AppDefense identifies a problem

## Install the dependencies

* Docker

## Build the ui and truffle containers

    make

## Deploy the contracts

    export PRODUCTION_URL=https://dev@blockchain.local:XXXX@$@mgmt.blockchain.vmware.com/blockchains/XXXX/api/concord/eth
    docker run -it -e PRODUCTION_URL incident-reporting-truffle truffle deploy --network production --reset

Output:

``` bash

Save the ID following `IncidentLog:` for use when setting your environment for running the server below.

## Running the UI service

Edit the `env` file to update the `CLIENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` line to match your IncidentLog id from above. Then run

     make ui
     make run-ui

### post an incident

    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request POST   --data '{"Reporter":"0xFE00BB37A56282d33680542Ae1CD6763660b5555","Message":"automatic reporting"}' localhost:8080/rest/log

### check it

    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request GET localhost:8080/rest/log/0

### use the ui

Open a browser to http://localhost:8080/log
